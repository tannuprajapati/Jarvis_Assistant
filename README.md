# Jarvis - Your Python Assistant Powered by Gemini API

**Jarvis** is a Python-based assistant designed to provide intelligent and seamless interactions using the Gemini API. Whether you need quick answers, data retrieval, or advanced AI capabilities, Jarvis is here to help!

## Features

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Leverages the Gemini API for natural language processing and intelligent responses.
- **Customizable**: Built with Python, allowing easy extensions and integrations for your needs.
- **Efficient and Responsive**: Handles tasks with speed and accuracy.

## Requirements

To run Jarvis, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.8 or later
- The Gemini API key
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
